## About Me
I am a doctor in Psychology (PhD) and currently holding a postdoctoral researcher position in Cognitive Neuroscience at the department of Experimental Psychology, Ghent University funded by the Flemish Research Council (FWO).

## Research Interest
Working memory (WM) and attention are two major conceptual pillars of human cognition, and how they relate to each other is a topic of intense interest at cognitive, neural, and theoretical levels of investigation. My research interests are in the mechanisms underlying **perceptual processing** and **working memory storage** of visual, spatial, and verbal information at the **behavioral** and **neural levels**. Moreover, I am interested in how abstract semantic knowledge and temporal information are processed and stored in working memory. I investigate these topics using **behavioral paradigms**, **eye-tracking**, and **fMRI**. 

## Short Bio
I completed my Ph.D. under the supervision of **Prof. Wim Fias** and **Prof. Tom Verguts** at the department of Experimental Pscyhology, Ghent Universtiy. During my PhD, I addressed the question how attention and working memory interact at the behavioral, neural and computational level. For the computational part, I got interested in modeling (e.g., mixture models) the distribution of attentional resources in WM for which I collaborated with the group of **Prof. Masud Husain** (University of Oxford). As for the neural part, I wanted to lay down the neural bases of attentional prioritisation in working memory using advanced machine learning techniques on fMRI data (e.g., MVPA, RSA, and IEM) for which I conducted a series of experiments as a visiting researcher in prof. **Bradley Postle's** lab  (University of Wisconsin-Madison).
