# Sahan Muhammet Ikbal 

I am a doctor in Psychology (PhD) and currently holding a postdoctoral researcher position in Cognitive Neuroscience at the department of Experimental Psychology, Ghent University funded by the Flemish Research Council (FWO).

## Research Interest
Working memory (WM) and attention are two major conceptual pillars of human cognition, and how they relate to each other is a topic of intense interest at cognitive, neural, and theoretical levels of investigation. My research interests are in the mechanisms underlying **perceptual processing** and **working memory storage** of visual, spatial, and verbal information at the **behavioral**, **computational**, and **neural levels**. Moreover, I am interested in how abstract semantic knowledge and temporal information are processed and stored in working memory. I investigate these topics using **behavioral paradigms**, **eye-tracking**, and **fMRI**. 

## Short Bio
I completed my Ph.D. under the supervision of **Prof. Wim Fias** and **Prof. Tom Verguts** at the department of Experimental Pscyhology, Ghent Universtiy. During my PhD, I addressed the question how attention and working memory interact at the behavioral, neural and computational level. For the computational part, I got interested in modeling (e.g., mixture models) the distribution of attentional resources in WM for which I collaborated with the group of **Prof. Masud Husain** (University of Oxford). As for the neural part, I wanted to lay down the neural bases of attentional prioritisation in working memory using advanced machine learning techniques on fMRI data (e.g., MVPA, RSA, and IEM) for which I conducted a series of experiments as a visiting researcher in prof. **Bradley Postle's** lab  (University of Wisconsin-Madison).

Following up on my PhD, I continued working with Prof. **Wim Fias** to investigate the role of spatial attention in more abstract domains of cognition like semantic knowledge and temporal information. My current research focuses on the involvement of the sensorimotor system, and in particular the oculomotor system for holding and processing temporal information. I have successfully obtained a post-doc research grant to address these questions. Within this framework, I am collaborating with prof. **Sebastiaan Mathôt** (University of Groningen) specifically to address the oculomotor involvement in working memory.
