## About Me
I am a doctor in Psychology (PhD) and currently holding a postdoctoral researcher position in Cognitive Neuroscience at the department of Experimental Psychology, Ghent University funded by the Flemish Research Council (FWO).

## Research Interest
My research interests are in the mechanisms underlying **perceptual processing** and **memory storage** of visual, spatial, and verbal information at the **behavioral** and **neural level**. Moreover, I am interested in how abstract semantic knowledge and temporal information are processed and stored in memory. I investigate these topics using **behavioral paradigms**, **eye-tracking**, **fMRI**, and **machine learning techniques**.
